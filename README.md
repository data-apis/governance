Consortium for Python Data API Standards.  The issue tracker of this repository
is meant to capture tasks and issues related to governance.

sub-groups and roles that exist in the Consortium and who fills each role,
including the relationship between collaborative open source development and
work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.
